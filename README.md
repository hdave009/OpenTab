# OpenTab
This project was created to address the problem of having to setup your browser with all the necessary tabs required when doing work for a certain course.
OpenTab uses a local PostgreSQL DB to store a course, and all the required tabs for that course with it. A simple UI was created using TKinter through which
a user can add/remove URL's associated with a course. 

Entering a course code, and selecting the Open Tabs option will open all the required tabs for that course in a Chrome window.
